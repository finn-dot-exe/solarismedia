# solaris media
Solaris Media is a gaming and tech multimedia blog that focuses on providing reviews and thoughts on video games, gaming culture, tech, and the internet from a unique perspective - None of that seemingly endless stream of copy and pasted buzzwords you often see on other sites. We aim to provide a more personal, engaging, and sometimes humorous take on the topics we cover. The goal is to have a place to decompress and share thoughts on the things we love, without the woes of being overly professional or polished in writing. The owner and editor-in-chief is finn.exe.
